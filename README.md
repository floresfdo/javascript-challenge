# javascript-challenge

Using javascript to write code to generate a table based on a given dataset.
This table will be dynamic by changing according to the filter desired by the user. 

The extra-terrestrial menace has come to Earth and we here at ALIENS-R-REAL have collected all of the eye-witness reports we could to prove it! 
All we need to do now is put this information online for the world to see and then the matter will finally be put to rest.
There is just one tiny problem though... our collection is too large to search through manually. 
Even our most dedicated followers are complaining that they are having trouble locating specific reports in this mess.
